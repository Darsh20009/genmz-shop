# Gen M&Z - Fashion E-commerce Platform

## Overview

Gen M&Z is a full-featured bilingual (Arabic/English) fashion e-commerce platform targeting Saudi Arabia's Gen M and Gen Z consumers. The platform features a minimalist, luxury aesthetic inspired by Zara and Everlane, with complete storefront functionality, shopping cart, user authentication, and an admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and customers.

The application follows a monorepo structure with a React frontend (Vite), Express backend, and PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM. It supports RTL layout for Arabic, dark/light themes, and is designed mobile-first with responsive breakpoints.
